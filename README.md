# State Tag Application (STA) in Vue.js
![STA Schematic Diagram](https://trafficjam.io/glide-public/HD/user-7/State_Tag_App_STA_Schematic.png?w=750)

##SPA or STA
Single Page Apps (SPAs) are great.  Just one question... what do we need the page for?  State Tag Apps (STAs) alleviate all that page pain.

- Way easier development cycles.
- Much better allocation of responsibilities.
- Same "free API" plus free GUI.

It's kind of insane.  We should have been doing it this way all along.

##Documentation & Licensing
Certain implementations using this technique are protected by business process patents.  However, licensing is cheap & simple.  [Go to http://StateTagApp.com for developer information, training, and licensing.](https://StateTagApp.com)
