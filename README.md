# State Tag Application (STA)
Create custom html tags that are able to do API calls and receive push socket events.

## SPA or STA
Single Page Apps (SPAs) are great.  Just one question: what do we need the page for?

State Tag Apps (STAs) alleviate all that page pain.

- Way easier development cycles.
- Much better allocation of responsibilities.
- Same "free API" plus free GUI.

It's kind of insane.  We should have been doing it this way all along.
